				<h2>Who I am</h2>
				<div class="about-me__body">
					I'm currently in my third year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and
					Business Administration. I am interested in a career in software engineering particularly
					in the FinTech industry. Some relevant coursework that I am currently taking are Web
					Development, Algorithms and Data, Computer Systems, and Database Design. I have completed
					two work experiences as a software engineer at CNC Software, Mastercam, and Google LLC. I
					am highly interested in expanding beyond my academic background and take on new challenges
					where I can apply what I have learned so far.
					<br />
					<br />
					Outside of my academics, I have been enthusiastic about basketball ever since I was a
					young kid. I started with playing street basketball in New York City, where I was born and
					raised, to travelling outside the country to play for my team. As I got older, I began to
					fade away from basketball and started weightlifting which has helped in making use my
					yearly university recreation fee. I also enjoy rock climbing (bouldering) and boxing in my
					free time.
