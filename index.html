				<h2>Who I am</h2>
				<div class="about-me__body">
					I'm currently in my second year at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and
					Business Administration. I am interested in a career in software engineering particularly
					in the FinTech industry. Some relevant coursework that I am currently taking are Software
					Development, Algorithms and Data, and Computer Systems. After completing Finnovate at
					Disrupt: The FinTech Initiative, an 8-week long program, I expanded on my skills of
					problem solving, teamwork, and design while exploring more about how FinTech can affect
					both big companies and individual consumers. I am highly interested in expanding beyond my
					academic background and take on new challenges where I can apply what I have learned so
					far.
					<br />
					<br />
					Outside of my academics, I have been enthusiastic about basketball ever since I was a
					young kid. I started with playing street basketball in New York City, where I was born and
					raised, to travelling outside the country to play for my team. As I got older, I began to
					fade away from basketball and started weightlifting which has helped in making use my
					yearly university recreation fee. In my downtime, I enjoy playing video games on my
					personally built computer with my close friends.
